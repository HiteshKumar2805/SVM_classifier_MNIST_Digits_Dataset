# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier on MNIST Digits Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to recognize handwritten digits using the popular MNIST Digits dataset. The SVM classifier uses a linear kernel to distinguish between the digits (0-9).

## Requirements
To run the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy
```

## Acknowledgments
- The `scikit-learn` library for providing easy access to the dataset and SVM implementation.
- The contributors of the MNIST dataset for their effort in creating and maintaining this valuable resource.
